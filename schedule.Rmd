## Unit 2: Assumptions & diagnostics

**Topic: Regression assumptions and diagnostics**

Objectives:

- Articulate the assumptions of the General Linear Model broadly and least squares estimation and inference particularly
- Describe sources of assumption violation in the regression model including: measurement error, non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, non-normally distributed residuals, correlated errors, and outliers.
- Articulate properties of residuals and describe their centrality in understanding the regression model assumptions
- Conduct diagnostic tests on regression model assumption violations
- Implement a consistent screening protocol to identify regression model assumption violations
- Implement solutions to regression model assumption violations, when appropriate

## Unit 3: Multiple regression

**Topic: Multiple Regression**

Objectives:

- Articulate the concepts of multiple regression and "statistical adjustment"
- Distinguish between the substantive implications of the terms "statistical control" and "statistical adjustment"
- Estimate the parameters of a multiple regression model
- Visually display the results of multiple regresion models
- State the main effects assumption and what the implication would be if it is violated
- Conduct statistical inference tests of single predictors ( $t$-test) and full model ( $F$-test) in multiple regression
- Decompose the total variance into its component parts (model and residual) and use the $R^2$ statistic to describe this decomposition
- Describe problems for regression associated with the phenomenon of multicollinearity
- Use visual schema (e.g., Venn diagrams) to assess regression models for the potential of multicollinearity
- Use statistical results (e.g., correlation matrices or heat maps) to assess regression models for the potential of multicollinearity
- Describe and implement some solutions to multi-collinearity
