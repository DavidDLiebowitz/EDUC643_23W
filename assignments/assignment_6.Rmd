### General Guidelines

The purpose of this assignment is to practice the concepts and vocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the techniques we have learned. You may work on your own or collaborate with one partner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and mutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you do collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses together, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate clearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource (outside of class material) you consulted in your responses.

### Submission Requirements

Please upload below two files on Canvas:  

1. An .html, .doc(x) or .pdf file that includes your typed responses (in your own words and not identical to anybody else's except your partner), tables, and/or figures to the problems
2. The .Rmd or .R file that you used to render the tables and figures in the above html/pdf.

### Data Background

#### Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA)

The data set we'll be using for this assignment is drawn from the Stanford Education Data Archive ([SEDA](https://edopportunity.org)) version 4.1. SEDA was launched in 2016 to provide nationally comparable, publicly available test score data for U.S. public school districts, allowing scientific inquiries on the relationships between educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes (especially student math/ELA achievements) at the district- (and school-) level across the nation. It contains rich variables including measures of academic achievement and achievement gaps for school districts and counties, as well as district-level measures of racial and socioeconomic composition, racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system. Some descriptive findings can be found [here](https://edopportunity.org/discoveries/). Findings from the SEDA data have drawn high-profile media coverage on levels of [inequality](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html) and differential [rates of growth](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/upshot/a-better-way-to-compare-public-schools.html) across districts.

**Analytic Sample**. Our data set is district-level data for all United States school districts, with some [restrictions](https://edopportunity.org/get-the-data/seda-archive-downloads/) due to enrollment and data availability. The test-score outcome data has been averaged across the 10 years of the data collection window. Observations with missing values on any of the key variables were deleted for simplification reasons. After these restrictions, our dataset includes 12,239 observations.

**Key variables**. The data set contains 24 variables, detailed below.

 * *sedalea*, NCES district ID
 * *sedaleaname*, district name
 * *fips*, state ID
 * *stateabb*, state abbreviation
 * *math*, average math achievement (2008/9 - 2017/18 school years), standardized to mean = 0, *SD* = 1
 * *read*, average reading/English Language Arts achievement (2008/9 - 2017/18 school years), standardized to mean = 0, *SD* = 1
 * *pernam*, district-level proportion of Native American students
 * *perasn*, district-level proportion of Asian students
 * *perhsp*, district-level proportion of Hispanic students
 * *perblk*, district-level proportion of Black students
 * *perwht*, district-level proportion of White students
 * *prfl*, district-level proportion of students eligible for free- or reduced-price school lunch
 * *perecd*, district-level proportion of students classified as Economically Disadvantaged
 * *perell*, district-level proportion of ELL students
 * *perspeced*, district-level proportion of students in special education program
 * *totenrl*, total district enrollment grades 3-8
 * *rsflnfl*, relative diversity index between schools, free lunch/nonfree lunch (range: 0-1)
 * *sesavgall*, Census-based SES composite index for all families residing within school district
 * *lninc50avgall*, Census-based log of median income for all families residing within school district
 * *baplusavgall*, Census-based Bachelor's degree-plus rate for all adults in families residing within district
 * *unempavgall*, Census-based unemployment rate for all families residing within district
 * *snapavgall*, Census-based SNAP receipt rate for all families residing within the district
 * *single_momavgall*, Census-based single-mother head of household rate for all families residing within the district
 * *locale*, Census-based location of schools attended by majority/plurality of students (Urban, Suburb, Town, Rural)
 

### Assignment Details

**Data preparation**: Open your RStudio, create a project and save it. Go to the root directory of the project and create folders named: "Code", "Data", "Figures" and "Tables." Download the [seda.csv dataset](../data/seda.csv) and store it in the folder "Data". Create an R script (or .Rmd) file in the Code folder. Read the data into your R environment. You do not need to include this part of the response in your memo; only in your code.
