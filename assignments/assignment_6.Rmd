### General Guidelines

The purpose of this assignment is to practice the concepts and vocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the techniques we have learned. You may work on your own or collaborate with one partner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and mutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you do collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses together, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate clearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource (outside of class material) you consulted in your responses.

### Submission Requirements

Please upload below two files on Canvas:  

1. An .html, .doc(x) or .pdf file that includes your typed responses (in your own words and not identical to anybody else's except your partner), tables, and/or figures to the problems
2. The .Rmd or .R file that you used to render the tables and figures in the above html/pdf.

### Objectives of this assignment


#### 4.2. Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA)

The data set we'll be using in our final project was drawn from the Stanford Education Data Archive ([SEDA](https://edopportunity.org)) version 4.1. SEDA was launched in 2016 to provide nationally comparable, publicly available test score data for U.S. public school districts, allowing scientific inquiries on the relationships between educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes (especially student math/ELA achievements) at the district-level across the nation. It contains rich variables including measures of academic achievement and achievement gaps for school districts and counties, as well as district-level measures of racial and socioeconomic composition, racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system. Some descriptive findings can be found [here](https://edopportunity.org/discoveries/).

**Analytic Sample**. Due to the large size of SEDA full data set, we focus on the school year 2017-18 data for the state of Oregon. Specifically, our data set is district-level data for 103 Oregon school districts. Observations with missing values on any of the key variables were deleted for simplification reasons.

**Key variables**. The data set contains 13 variables, detailed below.

 * *district*, name of the district
 * *subject*, coded "mth" fo Mathematics and "rla" for English/Language Arts
 * *grade*, coded 3, 4, 5, 6 for grades 3-6
 * *achievement*, grade-level average achievement test score 
 * *gap_gender*, grade-level male-female gender gap on achievement test 
 * *percent_ell*, district-level percentage of ELL students
 * *percent_sped*, district-level percentage of students in special education program
 * *percent_frl*, district-level percentage of students eligible for free or reduced school lunch
 * *percent_native*, district-level percentage of Native American students
 * *percent_asian*, district-level percentage of Asian students
 * *percent_hispanic*, district-level percentage of Hispanic students
 * *percent_black*, district-level percentage of African American students
 * *percent_white*, district-level percentage of white students
