# A motivating question

Researchers (including two from the .green[University of Oregon]), [Nichole Kelly, Elizabeth Cotter and Claire Guidinger (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2018.07.003), set out to understand the extent to which young men who exhibit overeating behaviors have weight-related medical and psychological challenges.

&lt;img src="kelly_etal.png" width="955" height="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Using real-world data (generously provided by Nichole Kelly) about the dietary habits, health, and self-appraisals of males 18-30, we are going to attempt to answer a similar question. 

However, before answering this question, we are going to explore **the relationship between dietary restraint behaviors** (self-reports on the extent to which participants consciously restricted/controlled their food intake) **and body-mass index (BMI).**

**The predicted BMI for a young male with a dietary restraint rating of 0 is 23.94 `\((\beta_0)\)`.**

**On average, each one unit difference in dietary restraint is positively associated with a 1.03 `\((\beta_1)\)` difference in BMI.**

The residual standard error (RSE) also known as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals. This summarizes the variability of observed values around the model-predicted values, in the original units of the outcome. This value is important to our homoscedasticity assumption (Unit 2).

`$$RSE = 6.086$$`

This means observed values vary around our model-predicted BMI with a standard deviation of 6.086. In BMI, 6 units is quite large!

---
# Degrees of freedom

Though it's not critical that you learn how to calculate the RMSE, it is relevant that is is a function of the **degrees of freedom** `\((df)\)` in your regression:

`$$RMSE = \frac{\text{sum of squares}}{n-(\text{# of parameters estimated})_{SS}}$$`
Our degrees of freedom decrease each time we use another parameter (add a predictor to our regression) to calculate the sum of squares. In a bivariate regression, our degrees of freedom (aka, the denominator) will always be `\(n-2\)` because we are estimating two parameters `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`.

With smaller samples and lots of covariates, we can quickly use up our degrees of freedom.

# Evaluating regression `\(R^2\)`

```

The R-squared value is .05.

This means that our model accounts for 5% of the variance in BMI. Since our model has only one predictor, we can alternatively say Dietary Restraint accounts for 5% of the variance in BMI.

- What about the rest? Measurement error, random individual variation, other causes (inherited traits, social phenomena, lack of access)


---
# What does (and doesn't) `\(R^2\)` mean?

`\(R^2\)` describes what proportion of the variation in the outcome the full regression model has explained.

Whether or not your model has a high or low `\(R^2\)` is:
- Disciplinary dependent
- Entirely independent from whether or not your model accurately characterizes the relationship

`\(R^2\)` does **NOT**:
- Imply anything about causality
- Tell us anything about whether there exists a linear or non-linear relationship (more on this soon)
- Tell us anything about the magnitude (steepness/shallowness) of the slope

# A review of inference

Go back to Units 2, 3 and 4 of EDUC 641 for a refresher on Null-Hypothesis Testing (NHST), the Central Limit Theorem and `\(t\)`-distributions.

# Slope `\((\hat{\beta_{1}})\)` sampling distribution 

.red[Add simulation of different estimated slopes producing histogram of values from 641/slides/continuous_l2.rmd]

The standard deviation of a sampling distribution is known as a .red[**standard error**].

---
# Basic review of NHST

We start by imagining a hypothetical world in which there is **no relationship** between X and Y in our true population. Then, we imagine drawing a series of samples over and over again (say...10,000 times) from this hypothetical population. What values of `\(\hat{\beta_{1}}\)` might we observe?

---
# `\(p\)`-values

The statistic that captures the likelihood that one would observe a value of `\(\hat{\beta_{1}}\)` of a given magnitude in a particular sample, in the presence of a null population, is called the .red[*p*-value].

Prior to interacting with our data, we set an **alpha threshold**; a probability threshold, below which we will consider `\(p\)` to be so small that it is unlikely that we would have gotten this result if the null were true, and we will reject the null hypothesis. Above this value, we will fail to reject the null.

In social science research, it is customary to (arbitrarily) set that threshold at **5 percent** ( `\(p\)`&lt;0.05). In other words, we say that if the difference between our observed data and our expected data would have happened in fewer than 1 out of 20 randomly drawn samples, that the difference reflects a true difference in the population.

# Statistical inference test of `\(\hat{\beta_{1}}\)`

Significance tests of regression coefficients test the null hypothesis that `\(\beta = 0\)`. (there is no linear relationship between the predictor and the outcome).

`$$\Large H_{0}: \beta_{1}= 0$$`
`$$\Large H_{1} \text{or} \Large H_{A}: \beta_{1} \neq 0$$`
Here, the `\(p\)`-value refers to the probability of obtaining a slope equal to or more extreme than `\(\beta\)` assuming `\(H_0\)` is true.

# Student's `\(t\)`-distribution

.pull-left[
- William Sealy Gosset, then a Head Experimental Brewer at Guiness Beer, wrote a pseudonymously published article in 1908 showing that estimates of `\((\hat{\beta_{1}})\)` divided by their standard error form a defined distribution
- This distribution is now known as Student's `\(t\)`-distribution
- Why *Student's* `\(t\)`-distribtion? Gosset's pseudonym was "Student"
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="gosset.jpg" width="267" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

The `\(t\)`-statistic represents an estimate of how many standard errors `\(\hat{\beta_1}\)` lies away from 0 in the `\(t\)`-distribution.

`$$t = \frac{\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_{1}}{SE(\hat{\beta_1})}$$`

- When we posit a null hypothesis, we assume that `\(\beta_{1}=0\)`
---
# `\(t\)`-distributions

* The degrees of freedom for our `\(t\)`-statistic is always *n*-1, where *n* is our sample size
* `\(t\)`-distributions with fewer degrees of freedom have "fatter" tails
* As the degrees of freedom get larger, the `\(t\)`-distribution approaches a standard normal distribution

  
  
&lt;img src="EDUC643_3_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# How large is enough?

Generally, as we get to around 50 degrees of freedom, our `\(t\)`-distribution approaches a standard normal distribution, and our inferences are straightforward because the `\(p\)`-values for our `\(t\)`-test are the same as `\(p\)`-values are in the standard normal distribution.

Under the null hypothesis, it is extremely unlikely to obtain a Dietary Restraint slope of 1.04 (p &lt; .001). Therefore, we can reject the null and conclude that there is a positive relationship between Dietary Restraint rating and BMI, on average in the population.

# `\(F\)`-Distributions and omnibus tests

The omnibus test uses the `\(F\)`-distribution to test the ratio of two variances (i.e., explained vs unexplained variance). This is a different, but similar, distribution to the `\(t\)`-distribution. For now, it's not critical that you know how it differs.

Null hypothesis: The model does not account for variance in Y.

If we reject the null, then the model accounts for more variance than we would expect by chance. 
---
# `\(F\)`-Distributions and omnibus tests

Just like tests with other probability distribution, we are testing the probability of obtaining a value (or more extreme value) of F under the `\(F\)`-Distribution.

`$$\Large F = \frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{residual}}$$`

Mean Squares (MS) are the Sums of Squares divided by their respective degrees of freedom.

We fit an Ordinary-Least Squares regression model to assess whether there is a relationship between BMI and Dietary Restraint, on average, in the population of young adult males. At an alpha threshold of `\(p\)`&lt;0.05, we found that Dietary Restraint was a significant predictor of BMI and accounted for approximately 5 percent of the variance in BMI. On average, each one unit difference in dietary restraint is positively associated with a 1.03 `\((\beta_1)\)` difference in BMI.

# Regressions as a prediction

Regression equations can be used to evaluate the relationship between variables, and to predict expected values based on particular values of our IVs.

We can ask: What is the expected BMI value for a young male with a Dietary Restraint rating of **4**?

--
`$$\Large BMI = 23.94 + 1.03*(\boldsymbol{4}) = 28.1$$`
The expected BMI for a Dietary Restraint of 4 is 28.1

--

Technically, there is no limit to what we can input!

# Predicting beyond your data

Regression equations can be used to evaluate the relationship between variables, and to predict expected values based on particular values of our IVs.

We can ask: What is the expected BMI value for a young male with a Dietary Restraint rating of **400**?

--

Using our measure, this is not a possible value of Dietary Restraint but we can still estimate BMI using our regression equation.

--
`$$\Large BMI = 23.94 + 1.03*(\boldsymbol{400}) = 439.9$$`
An adult would have to weigh 2,894 pounds at 5' 8" to have a BMI of 439.9.

--

**Only predict within the bounds of your data.**
