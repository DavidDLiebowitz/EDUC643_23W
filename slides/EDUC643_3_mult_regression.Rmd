# A motivating question


[Nichole Kelly, Elizabeth Cotter and Claire Guidinger (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2018.07.003) set out to understand the extent to which young men who exhibit overeating behaviors have weight-related medical and psychological challenges.

Using real-world data (generously provided by Nichole Kelly) about the dietary habits, health, and self-appraisals of males 18-30, we are going to attempt to answer a similar question. 

Up until now, we have been exploring a different question: How are **dietary restraint behaviors** (self-reports on the extent to which participants consciously restricted/controlled their food intake) and **body-mass index (BMI)** related?

.red-pink[**Now, we are going to turn to examine the relationship between overeating frequency and dietary restraint behaviors.**]


```{r, echo=F}
do <- read.spss(here("data/male_do_eating.sav"), to.data.frame=T) %>% 
    select(Study_ID, BMI, age_year, income_group, OE_frequency, 
         EDEQ_restraint, DERS_total, DMS_mean, EDS_total,  MBAS_muscularity, MBAS_height,
         SATAQ_total) %>%
        drop_na()
do <- rownames_to_column(do, "id")
do <- select(do, -c(Study_ID))

# Goals for the unit

- Articulate the concepts of multiple regression and .red-pink["statistical adjustment"]
- Distinguish between the substantive implications of the terms .red-pink["statistical control"] and .red-pink["statistical adjustment"]
- Estimate the parameters of a multiple regression model
- Visually display the results of multiple regresion models
- State the main effects assumption and what the implication would be if it is violated
- Conduct statistical inference tests of single predictors ( $t$-test) and full model ( $F$-test) in multiple regression
- Decompose the total variance into its component parts (model and residual) and use the $R^{2}$ statistic to describe this decomposition
- Describe problems for regression associated with the phenomenon of multicollinearity
- Use visual schema (e.g., Venn diagrams) to assess regression models for the potential of multicollinearity
- Use statistical results (e.g., correlation matrices or heat maps) to assess regression models for the potential of multicollinearity
- Describe and implement some solutions to multi-collinearity

# Bivariate relationship

Ok, so we can start out by examining each of these variables independently. 
```{r, echo=F}
#do <- filter(do, EDEQ_restraint!=0)
do %>% dplyr::select(OE_frequency, EDEQ_restraint) %>%
  summarise(
    mean(OE_frequency),
    sd(OE_frequency),
    mean(EDEQ_restraint),
    sd(EDEQ_restraint),
    cor(OE_frequency, EDEQ_restraint)
    )

# Regression diagnostics

We've looked a little already at the normality and linearity of our relationship. .blue[*What else can we look at?*] 

How can we test for homoscedasticity, linearity and normality in our residuals?

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)

.red-pink[The bulk of our residuals are roughly normally distributed, but we clearly have a long right tail. Perhaps we would want to test the sensitivity of our models for the exclusion of these outlying values?]

# Residuals v. fitted
```{r, echo=F, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(do, aes(x = predict, y = stu_resid)) +

  ylab("Studentized Residuals") + xlab("Fitted values") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

.red-pink[We are clearly under-predicting for some set of individuals. There is also some evidence of heteroscedasticity.]

There are some orange flags in our estimates here. In fact, we are conducting a different analysis than Kelly et al. (2018). They conducted a logistic regression for the presence of *any* medical or psychological challenges. We will learn how to do that analysis in EDUC 645. However, we are going to proceed with this analysis while noting that some of our assumptions may not be fully met.

# Multiple regression
Mathematically, we simply add additional terms to our equation like this:

$$\hat{OEFrequency_{i}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}DietaryRestraint_{i} + \beta_{2}BMI_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$

or more generally for $k$ predictors...

$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \cdots + \beta_{k}X_{k} + \varepsilon_{i}$$

---
# Multiple regression

Multiple regression helps us as follows:
1. Allows us to simultaneously consider many contributing factors in the relationship
2. We explain more of the variation in Y, and
3. We make more accurate predictions of Y (these both make our residuals smaller)
4. Provides a separate understanding of each predictor, adjusting for the effects of the other predictors (that is, holding the other predictors constant at their means)

# Power of multiple regression

Multiple regression can be a powerful tool to adjust for sample differences that depend on a variable other than the one in which we are interested and focus on the key question we have.

Take this example of a theoretical relationship between height and reading ability:
```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5}
set.seed(1234)
h <- rep(40, 1000)
g <- c("2nd", "3rd", "4th", "5th")    
grade <- rep(g, 250)
reading <- cbind.data.frame(grade, h)

reading <- reading %>% mutate(height = case_when(grade=="2nd" ~ h,
                                                        grade=="3rd" ~ h + 3,
                                                        grade=="4th" ~ h + 5,
                                                        grade=="5th" ~ h + 7))

reading <- reading %>% mutate(height = height + rnorm(length(height), 0, 4.5))

reading <- reading %>% mutate(read = rnorm(length(h)))

reading <- reading %>% mutate(read = case_when(grade=="2nd" ~ read,
                                               grade=="3rd" ~ read + .5,
                                               grade=="4th" ~ read + .8,
                                               grade=="5th" ~ read + 1.1))

reading <- reading %>% group_by(grade) %>% mutate(read = read + rnorm(length(read)))

rdplot <- ggplot(data=reading, aes(height, read)) + 
              geom_point() +

# Limits of multiple regression

However, sometimes, multiple regression cannot solve the problem if predictors are "too highly" correlated. For example, if women and men have unequal access to jobs of different status, adjusting for job status will not recover the relationship between gender and wages.<sup>[1]</sup>

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=4.5}
w <- seq(50001, 60000)
g <- c("Women", "Men")
gend <- rep(g, 5000)
s <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
stat <- rep(s, 1000)

gender <- as.data.frame(gend)
wages <- as.data.frame(w)
status <- as.data.frame(stat)

discr <- arrange(gender, desc(gend)) %>% cbind(., wages)
discr <- arrange(status, stat) %>% cbind(., discr)

discr <- discr %>% group_by(stat) %>% mutate(wage = w + rnorm(length(w), 0, 100))
discr <- discr %>% mutate(status = stat + rnorm(length(stat), 0, 0.05))

ggplot(data=discr, aes(status, wage)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)

# Limits of multiple regression

However, once we adjust for job status, there is no wage differential, on average in the population, between men and women:
```{r, echo=T}
tidy(lm(wage ~ gend + status, data=discr))

--

If two predictors are "too highly" correlated, we can't adjust for one to evaluate the effects of the other. This is known as .red[**multicollinearity**].

---
# Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables are highly related to each other.

This can be a simple relationship, such as when two of our predictors are strongly related to one another. This is usually straightforward to recognize, interpret, and correct for.

Sometimes multicollinearity is difficult to detect, such as when our variable of interest (e.g., $X_{1}$) is not strongly correlated with any one $X_{k}$, but the combination of the $X$s is a strong predictor of $X_{1}$.

--

### Multicollinearity biases our regression estimates and increases the standard errors of our regression coefficients.

# Venn diagrams of collinearity

# Estimates of collinearity in R

```{r, echo=F}
cordat <- do %>% select(EDS_total, OE_frequency, BMI, MBAS_muscularity, MBAS_height, DMS_mean) %>%
  rename(EDS_tot = EDS_total,
         OE_freq = OE_frequency,
         MBAS_musc = MBAS_muscularity)
```
```{r, echo=T}
cormat <- round(cor(cordat),3)
cormat[lower.tri(cormat)] <- NA
print(cormat)
```

---
# Visual heatmap

```{r, echo=F}
melt_corm <- melt(cormat, na.rm=T)
ggplot(data = melt_corm, aes(Var2, Var1, fill = value))+
 geom_tile(color = "white")+
 scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "white", 
   midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab", 
   name="Pearson\nCorrelation") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)

```
---
# Correlation and collinearity

Perfect collinearity never happens (except in the instance of a duplicated variable). There are degrees of multicollinearity. 

### More multicollinearity = more problematic model.

--

In practice, when we detect problems with collinearity, what we are really detecting is strongly correlated predictors. 

Note that in the example of height and grade, once we partial out grade, there is no relationship between height and reading. However, after partialling out height, there is still a relationship between grade and reading. This is because there is still variation in grade at each value of height.  

.red[**Don't abuse the term collinear!**]

# Putting multicollinearity together

1. **Statistical adjustments can help recover the "true" relationship in your data that is obscured by confounding variables.**
2. **When two variables are highly correlated, it may be impossible to adjust for one**
 - This is known as the problem of .red[**multicollinearity**] (*though the term is not quite right!*)
3. **Graphical representations (such as Venn diagrams) can help you conceptualize the potential for multicollinearity**
4. **Use correlation matrices to detect for the phenomenon of highly correlated variables**
 - Consider visual representations to detect patterns more easily
5. **Solutions to multicollinearity**:
 - Increase sample size, remove a variable, create a composite or factor score (more to come in EDUC 645!)
