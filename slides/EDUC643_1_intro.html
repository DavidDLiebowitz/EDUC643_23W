# A motivating question

Researchers (including two from the .green[University of Oregon]), [Nichole Kelly, Elizabeth Cotter and Claire Guidinger (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2018.07.003), set out to understand the extent to which young men who exhibit overeating behaviors have weight-related medical and psychological challenges.

&lt;img src="kelly_etal.png" width="955" height="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Using real-world data (generously provided by Nichole Kelly) about the dietary habits, health, and self-appraisals of males 18-30, we are going to attempt to answer a similar question. 

However, before answering this question, we are going to explore **the relationship between dietary restraint behaviors** (self-reports on the extent to which participants consciously restricted/controlled their food intake) **and body-mass index (BMI).**

# A glance at the data
Let's start by focusing on these two variables of interest: dietary restraint (*EDEQ_restraint*) and body-mass index (*BMI*).

```r
summary(do$EDEQ_restraint)
```

```
#&gt;    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.

# Bivariate relationships

We are interested in the *relationship* between dietary restraint (*EDEQ_restraint*) and body-mass index (*BMI*). Statistically, the relationship is the same regardless of which variable is the outcome.

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

However, our convention is to consider the variable on the Y-axis to be the one that we interpret as the "outcome" or the "dependent" variable.
---
# Bivariate relationships

For pedagogical reasons, for the moment, we are choosing to plot BMI against dietary restraint. 

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Bivariate relationships

**Consider these five features of bivariate relationships:**

- Direction
- Linearity
- Outliers
- Strength
- Magnitude

---
# Bivariate relationships: Direction

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Bivariate relationships: Linearity

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Bivariate relationships: Outliers

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Bivariate relationships: Strength

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Note that these have the same slope**
---
# Bivariate relationships: Magnitude

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
**Note that these have the same strength**

# BMI vs. eating restraint

.blue[So what can we say with respect to these five characteristics in our data?]

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# A line through our cloud

Notice that in the previous slide, we added a line running through our data

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
That line is defined by the intercept (value `\(Y\)` takes when `\(X=0\)`) and the slope (the difference in `\(Y\)` per 1 unit difference in `\(X\)`)
&gt; `\(Y = intercept + slope*X\)` (you may have seen this in HS as Y = mX + b)

&gt; We could think of this relationship, therefore, as `\(BMI = slope*EDEQrestraint + intercept\)` ... .purple[but that's not quite right]


---
# Mathematical representations

In addition to visual representations, we can borrow from mathematical models to construct a statistical relationship between variables. However, these are not identical.

.pull-left[
**Mathematical models**

- Are deterministic
- The area of any square is always `\(s^{2}\)`
- Once we know the rule, we can use it to fit the model to data perfectly
]

.pull-right[
**Statistical models**

- Include individual variation
- Other systematic components exist that are either not measured or observable
- Outcome = Systematic component + residual
]

--

.blue[*What is wrong about describing the relationship between BMI and eating restraint as we did on the previous slide?*]

---
# Statistical model

In order to develop our statistical model (inspired by a deterministic mathematical model), we need to first determine our model's functional form.

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

.blue[All of the models we will focus on in this course and next are linear. Why?]

---
# Linear models

### Why are straight lines so popular in statistics?
1. Mathematical simplicity: straight lines are one of the simplest (and consistent) ways of characterizing relationships
2. Actual linearity: many relationships are best characterized linearly

### What if my data isn't related in linear ways
1. Transformations: we will learn how to use these later to fit linear models to curvilinear data
2. Limited ranges of X may yield linearity: most things are "locally linear"

.red[**In fact, linear modeling is so tractable that this is what we will spend the entire course on! And the next one (EDUC 645)!**]

--

We'll learn about lots of different modeling approaches. .red[**They are all part of the same family of models, known as the General Linear Model (GLM)**]. We will learn more about this GLM in Unit 4.

---
# Linear reqression equation

Okay, so once we have selected our model's functional form (which for now and the foreseeable future is going to be "linear"), we can move on to a mathematical representation. In this case, we are going to specify a .red[**linear regression**] model.

A linear regression equation borrows the mathematical framework for a line to summarize this relationship.
`$$BMI = \beta_0 + \beta_1(DietaryRestraint)$$`
---
# Regression equations

The regression line describes the mean value of Y for each possible "input" value of X.

`$$BMI = \beta_0 + \beta_1(DietaryRestraint)$$`

--
Our data already provides us with observations of BMI and dietary restraint:


```
#&gt;   EDEQ_restraint      BMI
#&gt; 1            0.0 23.32485
#&gt; 2            1.2 16.62282
#&gt; 3            0.4 18.74667
#&gt; 4            0.4 15.44678
#&gt; 5            0.0 20.22119
#&gt; 6            1.2 26.28313
```

--
So, modelling requires us to find the best intercept `\((\beta_0)\)` and slope `\((\beta_1)\)` to represent the relationship.

---
# Regression equation components

`$$BMI = \color{orange}{(\beta_0)} + \color{purple}{(\beta_1)}(DietaryRestraint)$$`

&lt;span style = "color:orange"&gt; Intercept `\((\beta_0)\)`: &lt;/span&gt; Predicted outcome when X is equal to 0.

--

&lt;span style = "color:purple"&gt; Slope `\((\beta_1)\)`: &lt;/span&gt; Predicted increase in the outcome for every one unit increase in X.

--

**Write out the appropriate regression equation for a line that has an intercept of 20 and Dietary Restraint slope of 1.5.**

---
# Regression equation components

&lt;span style = "color:orange"&gt; Intercept `\((\beta_0)\)`: &lt;/span&gt; Predicted outcome when X is equal to 0.

&lt;span style = "color:purple"&gt; Slope `\((\beta_1)\)`: &lt;/span&gt; Predicted increase in the outcome for every one unit increase in X.


`$$BMI = \color{orange}{20} + \color{purple}{1.5}(DietaryRestraint)$$`
**What is the expected BMI value for a Dietary Restraint rating of 2?**
---
# Regression equation components

&lt;span style = "color:orange"&gt; Intercept `\((\beta_0)\)`: &lt;/span&gt; Predicted outcome when X is equal to 0.

&lt;span style = "color:purple"&gt; Slope `\((\beta_1)\)`: &lt;/span&gt; Predicted increase in the outcome for every one unit increase in X.



`$$BMI = \color{orange}{20} + \color{purple}{1.5}(2) = 20 + 3 = 23$$`
**For a Dietary Restraint rating of 2, the predicted BMI value is 23.**

# Error/residual term
"No model is perfect, but some are useful." - George Box

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Is Dietary Restraint a perfect predictor of BMI? 

--

.red[NO!]

---
# Omitted variables
A "perfect" regression equation would probably include a lot more variables:

`$$BMI = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{Dietary Restraint}) + \beta_2(\text{Meal Frequency}) + \beta_3(\text{Nutritional Habits})... \beta_\infty$$`
Many of these might not even be measurable!

--

Omitted variables are not a problem in themselves. Our estimates of the relationship between two (or more) variables might still be unbiased (i.e., accurately describe the nature of the relationship in the population), but they may be less precise because we have not explained all of the variation.

--

However, omitted variables often introduce bias into our estimates of the relationship. More on the problem of omitted variable bias later.

---
# Residual/Error term

In a regression model, all the variability that we couldn't explain with our predictor is condensed into a &lt;span style="color:green"&gt; residual term `\(\varepsilon\)` &lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

`$$BMI = \beta_0 + \beta_1(DietaryRestraint) + \color{green}{\varepsilon}$$`
---
# The regression model

So there it is! Our full population regression model:

`$$Y = \color{blue}{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X} + \color{green}{\varepsilon}$$`
&lt;div style= "text-align:center"&gt; Outcome = .blue[Systematic component] + .green[residual]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; `\(Y\)`: our outcome &lt;br&gt;
`\(\color{blue}{\beta_{0}}\)` and `\(\color{blue}{\beta_{1}}\)`: our population parameters and regression coefficients to be estimated &lt;br&gt;
`\(\color{green}{\varepsilon}\)`: our error/residual ( `\(\varepsilon\)` is a fancy way of writing the Greek letter "epsilon")

Also written as:

`$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$`
where we use the subscript `\(i\)` to emphasize that the model estimates the outcome for each of the `\(i\)` units (students, schools, patients, etc.).

.footnote[[1] Sometimes also called deterministic and stochastic components.]
---
# A fitted model

A **fitted model** takes our popualtion model and uses our observed data to derive estimates for the population. 
`$$\hat{Y_{i}} = \hat{\beta_{0}} + \hat{\beta_{1}} X_{i}$$`
We denote that we are generating estimates with "hats" above the estimated coefficients. Note that there is ***no error term*** in our fitted model. 

---
# Residuals

For any observation, the residual is the difference between the observed and predicted value.

`$$\varepsilon_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}$$`


---
# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

An OLS-fitted regression would go through the "center" of the data, finding the best intercept and slope to minimize the total distance between all of the residual and itself.


&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

For some observations we under-predict, for others we over-predict. But, across the full sample, no matter where we put our line, the residuals will always sum to zero. .blue[So how do we calculate the "best" line?]

---
# Sum of the squared residuals

For any observation, the residual is the difference between the observed and predicted value.

`$$\varepsilon_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}$$`

Squaring the residual terms `\((\varepsilon_i^2)\)` allows us to treat negative and positive deviations equally, and puts a greater penalty on larger deviations.


```

The **sum of squares** is the sum of all our squared residuals:

`$$\Large \Sigma(\varepsilon_i)^2$$`

# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

]

Using the OLS method, the regression line on the left is a better fit (67,314 &lt; 100,859).

# Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)

SSR is a grander concept than just model predictions. It is a way of thinking about variability.

--

Our outcome's variability is simply the sum of squared deviations from its mean.

`$$SSR_\text{BMI} = \sum{(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}$$`

---

# Partitioning variance

The goal of regression is to account for some of this variability with our model's predictors.

We can partition the outcome's total variance ( `\(SS_{BMI}\)`) into:
* Model-accounted variance ( `\(SS_\text{Model}\)`)
* Residual variance ( `\(SS_\text{Residual}\)`)

`$$SS_\text{BMI} = SS_\text{Model} + SS_\text{Residual}$$`
--

Remember our goal with OLS regression is to find the model coefficients that minimize `\(SS_\text{Residual}\)`.


---
# Partitioning variance
`$$\text{If } SS_\text{BMI} = \color{purple}{SS_\text{Model}} + {SS_\text{Residual}}$$`

`\(\color{purple}{SS_\text{Model}}\)` is the sum of squared deviations between the model predicted values `\((\hat{Y})\)` and the mean `\((\bar{Y})\)`.

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
`$$\color{purple}{SS_\text{Model} = \sum{(\hat{Y} - \bar{Y})^2}}$$`
---
# Partitioning variance
`$$\text{If } SS_\text{BMI} = \color{purple}{SS_\text{Model}} + \color{green}{SS_\text{Residual}}$$`

`\(\color{green}{SS_\text{Residual}}\)` is the sum of squared deviations between the model predicted values `\((\hat{Y})\)` and the observed values `\((Y)\)`.

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
`$$\color{green}{SS_\text{Model} = \sum{(Y - \hat{Y})^2}}$$`

---
# `\(R^2\)`

Partitioning variance can be useful for model evaluation.

`$$SS_\text{BMI} = SS_\text{Model} + SS_\text{Residual}$$`
`\(R^2\)` ("R-squared") is the proportion of variance in the outcome our model accounts for.

`$$R^2 = \frac{SS_\text{Model}}{SS_\text{BMI}}$$`
--
For example, if `\(R^2 = 0.30\)`, then our model accounts for 30% of our sample's variance in BMI.

More on this soon.

The residual standard error (RSE) also known as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals. This summarizes the variability of observed values around the model-predicted values, in the original units of the outcome. This value is important to our homoscedasticity assumption (Unit 2).

`$$RSE = 6.086$$`

This means observed values vary around our model-predicted BMI with a standard deviation of 6.086. In BMI, 6 units is quite large!

---
# Degrees of freedom

Though it's not critical that you learn how to calculate the RMSE, it is relevant that is is a function of the **degrees of freedom** `\((df)\)` in your regression:

`$$RMSE = \frac{\text{sum of squares}}{n-(\text{# of parameters estimated})_{SS}}$$`
Our degrees of freedom decrease each time we use another parameter (add a predictor to our regression) to calculate the sum of squares. In a bivariate regression, our degrees of freedom (aka, the denominator) will always be `\(n-2\)` because we are estimating two parameters `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`.

With smaller samples and lots of covariates, we can quickly use up our degrees of freedom.

The R-squared value is .05.

This means that our model accounts for 5% of the variance in BMI. Since our model has only one predictor, we can alternatively say Dietary Restraint accounts for 5% of the variance in BMI.

# What does (and doesn't) `\(R^2\)` mean?

`\(R^2\)` describes what proportion of the variation in the outcome the full regression model has explained.

Whether or not your model has a high or low `\(R^2\)` is:
- Disciplinary dependent
- Entirely independent from whether or not your model accurately characterizes the relationship

`\(R^2\)` does **NOT**:
- Imply anything about causality
- Tell us anything about whether there exists a linear or non-linear relationship (more on this soon)
- Tell us anything about the magnitude (steepness/shallowness) of the slope

# Basic review of NHST

We start by imagining a hypothetical world in which there is **no relationship** between X and Y in our true population. Then, we imagine drawing a series of samples over and over again (say...10,000 times) from this hypothetical population. What values of `\(\hat{\beta_{1}}\)` might we observe?

---
# `\(p\)`-values

The statistic that captures the likelihood that one would observe a value of `\(\hat{\beta_{1}}\)` of a given magnitude in a particular sample, in the presence of a null population, is called the .red[*p*-value].

Prior to interacting with our data, we set an **alpha threshold**; a probability threshold, below which we will consider `\(p\)` to be so small that it is unlikely that we would have gotten this result if the null were true, and we will reject the null hypothesis. Above this value, we will fail to reject the null.

In social science research, it is customary to (arbitrarily) set that threshold at **5 percent** ( `\(p\)`&lt;0.05). In other words, we say that if the difference between our observed data and our expected data would have happened in fewer than 1 out of 20 randomly drawn samples, that the difference reflects a true difference in the population.

Under the null hypothesis, it is extremely unlikely to obtain a Dietary Restraint slope of 1.04 (p &lt; .001). Therefore, we can reject the null and conclude that there is a positive relationship between Dietary Restraint rating and BMI, on average in the population.

We fit an Ordinary-Least Squares regression model to assess whether there is a relationship between BMI and Dietary Restraint, on average, in the population of young adult males. At an alpha threshold of `\(p\)`&lt;0.05, we found that Dietary Restraint was a significant predictor of BMI and accounted for approximately 5 percent of the variance in BMI. On average, each one unit difference in dietary restraint is positively associated with a 1.03 `\((\beta_1)\)` difference in BMI.

# Correlations

* Correlation coefficients `\((r)\)` describe the **strength** of a linear relationship between two variables. 

* The concept was first developed by Karl Pearson a eugenics professor at the University College of London. He held many despicable [views](https://nautil.us/issue/92/frontiers/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics).

* He (along with Francis Galton and RA Fisher) also pioneered many of the basic tools of modern statistics, including standard deviation, `\(\chi^2\)`, goodness of fit and correlation

* Correlations are dimensionless measures that eliminate the metrics of any particular scale. To do so requires **standardizing** each variable.

---
# Standardizing variables

* Any variable can be standardized using a simple algorithm.

Each observation `\((i)\)` is transformed into standardized form using the following formula:

`$$z_{i} = \frac{X_{i} - \mu}{\sigma}$$`

* The standardized value is calculated calculated by **subtracting the mean** from each value and **dividing by the standard deviation**.

* The sample mean of the new variable is 0 and its standard deviation is 1

* The new values represent an observation's distance from the mean in standard deviation units.

* Values range from -1 to 1
  + Positive Values - higher values of Y `\(\rightarrow\)` higher values of X (and vice-versa)
  + Negative Values - higher values of Y `\(\rightarrow\)` lower values of X (and vice-versa)

* **Doesn't change anyone's relative rank**

* **Doesn't create a normally distributed variable**

# Divorce and Beef

What can we conclude? - Do increases in Oregon's divorce rate **cause** increases in U.S. beef consumption, or do increases in beef consumption **cause** increases in the divorce rate?

--

**Probably neither...**

--

We tested for a linear relationship. There is a significant linear relationship (or correlation) between divorce rate and beef consumption, but we have not established a causal relationship.

**We cannot establish causality, nor the direction of the relationship with a statistical test.**

# Spurious correlation

&lt;img src="EDUC643_1_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

A third variable causes changes in X and also in Y. Sometimes called a .red[*confounder*].

&gt; .small[It is easy to prove that the wearing of tall hats and the carrying of umbrellas enlarges the chest, prolongs life, and confers comparative immunity from disease...A university degree, a daily bath, the owning of thirty pairs of trousers, a knowledge of Wagner’s music, a pew in church, anything, in short, that implies more means and better nurture…can be statistically palmed off as a magic spell conferring all sorts of privileges...The mathematician whose correlations would fill a Newton with admiration, may, in collecting and accepting data and drawing conclusions from them, fall into quite crude errors by just such popular oversights. -George Bernard Shaw (1906)]

# Why correlation `\(\neq\)` causation?

Other common problems include:
- [Colliders](http://www.the100.ci/2017/03/14/that-one-weird-third-variable-problem-nobody-ever-mentions-conditioning-on-a-collider/): a third variable that is caused by both the predictor and outcome; controlling for this can make a true causal relationship disappear!
- Reverse causation: X may cause Y **or** Y may cause X
- Simpson's Paradox: a third variable may reverse the correlation
- Also, **lack** of correlation `\(\neq\)` **lack** of causality

# From correlation to causality

### Five criteria for establishing causality:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Cause must precede effect in time
2. Identified mechanism
3. Consistency
4. Responsiveness
5. No plausible alternative explanation

Highest priority is establishing .red[**exogeneous variation**] in exposure to some "treatment."

Research design is critical. So too can be [Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2515245917745629). We have whole classes dedicated to just this topic (EDLD 650, EDLD 679).

# Turn and Talk

* Discuss science communication and how you would distinguish correlations from causal relationships to the average person.

* In what contexts might it be difficult to conduct an experimental study to establish causality?
