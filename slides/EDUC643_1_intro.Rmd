# Goals of EDUC quant sequence

- Develop the basic quantitative skills necessary to conduct applied data analysis
 + The full-year sequence (EDUC 641 $\rightarrow$ EDUC 643 $\rightarrow$ EDUC 645) prepares you to make valuable contributions to a research team
 + Not all the skills you will need (and not the only courses you should take), particularly for those interested in analysis-heavy positions, or becoming an applied quantitative doctoral-level researcher
 + Foundations of statistics, methods and data science

- Understand the (in)appropriate application of those skills
 + "Building a toolbox, not a cookbook"
 + Evaluate the credibility of published research
 + Understand the affordances, limitations and dangers of quantitative analysis

--

.blue[This is an entirely re-designed and modernized core quantitative sequence at the COE. We welcome your feedback!] 

.blue[Given the new-ness of these three courses, there are likely to be shortcomings. We are committed to solving them as they arise, but we ask for your grace in allowing us to do so. In the end, we think this will be a better experience for you and your future program-mates.]

---
# Pedagogical orientation of EDUC

- Analysis follows research design that emerges from substantive questions
- Students learn statistical analysis by doing statistical analysis
- Start from an assumption of no prior background in mathematics, programming, statistics or research
- Create an inclusive, supportive environment in which we learn from each other
- Balance support and academic stretch across a variety of levels of prior experience and comfort with quantitative analysis

--

<br>

.blue[**Social conventions and schooling practices often convince some people, particularly women,  people of color and disabled individuals, that they are “bad at math.” We believe that quantitative skills, like any other skills, are built through regular practice, over time, and that all of our students can be successful in the EDUC quantitative sequence.**]

.blue[**We encourage all students, particularly those underrepresented in this field, to pursue the EDUC sequence and additional quantitative analysis courses in the COE and around the UO.**]

---
# Goals of EDUC 641

We will focus on describing categorical and continuous data and quantifying relationships between categorical and continuous data. Students will form a solid foundation for frequentist, inferential statistics (and some of critiques of this model). The course seeks to blend a conceptual, mathematical and applied understanding of basic statistical concepts.

Concrete learning objectives:
1. Articulate the principles of responsible and ethical quantitative research
2. Describe, summarize and visualize quantitative data that are categorical and continuous
3. Describe, summarize and visualize the relationships between quantitative data that are categorical and continuous
4. Conduct a frequentist null-hypothesis significance test of the relationships between simple categorical and continuous data
5. Describe strategies to improve the replicability and generalizability of quantitative research
6. Use the R programming language to conduct all such analyses

---
# My personal goals

- Over next two terms, teach you the basics of applied statistics
- Challenge you:
  + These courses assume .blue[*no prior knowledge*] of either programming or math, beyond high-school Algebra I
  + Thus, I hope EDUC 641 provides a smooth on-ramp for everyone
  + If you're struggling, come talk to me
  + If the course is too basic, consider either recommended texts for more formal mathematical treatment **AND/OR** the R Bootcamp extension activities (it will get more challenging) **AND/OR** reflect on pedagogical approaches as a future instructor
- Induct you into a graduate-level focus on mastery, rather than an undergraduate-level focus on success
- Contribute to building a community of live learners and life-long professional colleagues
- Assign everyone an A

# Goals for the unit

- Describe goals and structure and of the course (and the quantitative EDUC sequence more broadly)
- Characterize a bivariate relationship along five dimensions (direction, linearity, outliers, strength and magnitude)

.gray[
- Describe how statistical models differ from deterministic models
- Mathematically represent the population model and interpret its deterministic and stochastic components
- Formulate a linear regression model to hypothesize a population relationship
- Estimated a fitted regression line using Ordinary-Least Squares regression
- Describe residuals and how they can describe the degree of our OLS model fit
- Explain $R^{2}$, both in terms of what it tells us and what it does not
- Conduct an inference test for a regression coefficient and our regression model
- Calculate a correlation coefficient $(r)$ and describe its relationship to $R^{2}$
- Distinguish between research designs that permit correlational associations and those that permit causal inferences

# A motivating question

Researchers (including two from the .green[University of Oregon]), [Nichole Kelly, Elizabeth Cotter and Claire Guidinger (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2018.07.003), set out to understand the extent to which young men who exhibit overeating behaviors have weight-related medical and psychological challenges.

```{r, echo=F, out.height="85%"}
include_graphics("kelly_etal.png")
```

.small[Using real-world data (generously provided by Nichole Kelly) about the dietary habits, health, and self-appraisals of males 18-30, we are going to attempt to answer a similar question.]

.small[However, before answering this question, we are going to explore **the relationship between dietary restraint behaviors** (self-reports on the extent to which participants consciously restricted/controlled their food intake) **and body-mass index (BMI).**]

---
## Quantitative research design components

1. **Research questions**
 + Descriptive
 + Relational
 + Causal
2. **Question predictors / independent variables (IV)**
 + Fixed attributes (e.g., race, age)
 + Potentially changeable characteristics (e.g., trauma, class size)
 + Interventions (e.g., new curriculum, counseling, programs/policies)
3. **Outcomes / dependent variables (DV)**
4. **Analytic strategy**

# A glance at the data
```{r, echo=T}
do <- read_spss(here("data/male_do_eating.sav")) %>% 
    select(OE_frequency, EDEQ_restraint, EDS_total,
           BMI, age_year, income_group) 

head(do)
```

# More

```{r, echo=T}

str(do)
```

---
# More glances

```{r, echo=T}

# Check for missingness
sapply(do, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
# note: we are focusing only on those cases that had complete records  
#       for all these variables
```
---
# A glance at the data
Let's start by focusing on these two variables of interest: dietary restraint (*EDEQ_restraint*) and body-mass index (*BMI*).
```{r, echo=T}
summary(do$EDEQ_restraint)
summary(do$OE_frequency)
summary(do$EDS_total)
```

---
# Oh the tangled web SPSS weaves!

```{r, echo=T, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data=do, aes(EDS_total)) + geom_bar()

do <- do %>% mutate(EDS_total = ifelse(EDS_total==-99, NA, EDS_total))

sum(is.na(do$EDS_total))
```

---
# Bivariate relationships

We are interested in the *relationship* between dietary restraint (*EDEQ_restraint*) and body-mass index (*BMI*). Statistically, the relationship is the same regardless of which variable is the outcome.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=F}
ggplot(do, aes(x=BMI, y=EDEQ_restraint)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("BMI Predicting Dietary Restraint") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F}
ggplot(do, aes(x = EDEQ_restraint, y = BMI)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Dietary Restraint Predicting BMI") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)

```
]

--

However, our convention is to consider the variable on the Y-axis to be the one that we interpret as the "outcome" or the "dependent" variable.

# Bivariate relationships

For pedagogical reasons, for the moment, we are choosing to plot BMI against dietary restraint. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.height=4, fig.width = 6}
lm_plot <- ggplot(do, aes(x=EDEQ_restraint, y=BMI)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("BMI vs Dietary restraint") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)


lm_plot
```

# Bivariate relationships

**Consider these five features of bivariate relationships:**

- Direction
- Linearity
- Outliers
- Strength
- Magnitude

# Bivariate relationships: Direction

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5}
set.seed(123)
x <- seq(0, 50)
y <- x + 10 + rnorm(length(x), 0, 5)
y2 <- abs(x-50) + 10 + rnorm(length(x), 0, 5)
pos <- cbind.data.frame(x, y)
neg <- cbind.data.frame(x, y2)

positive <- ggplot(pos, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Positive") +
  theme_minimal(base_size=16) +

# Bivariate relationships: Linearity

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5}
y3 <- log(y)*15 
tri <- cbind.data.frame(x, y3)

poly <- ggplot(tri, aes(x, y3)) +
  geom_point() +

  theme_minimal(base_size=16) +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(linear, poly, ncol=2)
```

---
# Bivariate relationships: Outliers

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5}
pos <- pos %>% mutate(out = case_when(x == 37 | x == 39 | x == 41 | x == 42 ~ y - 30,
                                       TRUE ~ y))

outlier <- ggplot(pos, aes(x, out)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Outliers") +
    theme_minimal(base_size=16) +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(linear, outlier, ncol=2)

```

---
# Bivariate relationships: Strength

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5}
pos <- pos %>% mutate(y4 = x + 20 + rnorm(length(x), 0, 15))

strong <- ggplot(pos, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=F) +
  ggtitle("Stronger") +
  theme_minimal(base_size=16) +
    expand_limits(y=c(0,100)) +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) 

weak <- ggplot(pos, aes(x, y4)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=F) +
  ggtitle("Weaker") +
  theme_minimal(base_size=16) +
    expand_limits(y=c(0,100)) +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(strong, weak, ncol=2)
```

**Note that these have the same slope**

# Bivariate relationships: Magnitude

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5}
pos <- pos %>% mutate(y5 = 1.75*x + 10 + rnorm(length(x), 0, 5))


shallow <- ggplot(pos, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=F) +
  ggtitle("Relatively shallow") +
  theme_minimal(base_size=16) +
    expand_limits(y=c(0,100)) +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) 

steep <- ggplot(pos, aes(x, y5)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=F) +
  ggtitle("Relatively steep") +
  theme_minimal(base_size=16) +
    expand_limits(y=c(0,100)) +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(steep, shallow, ncol=2)
```
**Note that these have the same strength**

# BMI vs. eating restraint

.blue[So what can we say with respect to these five characteristics in our data?]

```{r, echo = F, fig.height=5}
lm_plot +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=F)
```
---
# A line through our cloud

Notice that in the previous slide, we added a line running through our data

```{r, echo = F, fig.height=4.5}
lm_plot +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=F)
```
That line is defined by the intercept (value $Y$ takes when $X=0$) and the slope (the difference in $Y$ per 1 unit difference in $X$)
> $Y = intercept + slope*X$ (you may have seen this in HS as Y = mX + b)

> We could think of this relationship, therefore, as $BMI = slope*EDEQrestraint + intercept$ ... .purple[but that's not quite right]
